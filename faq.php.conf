$faq['The GPGTools Project and Installer'] = array(
    'What is GPG?' => 'GPG (or GnuPG) is an open source implementation of PGP. Please have a look at our <a href="intro.php">introduction on how PGP works</a>.',
    'What is GPGTools?' => 'GPGTools is an initiative to bring GPG to Apple OS X. We provide both an all-in-one installer for all necessary software components and a home for OpenPGP related software for the Mac.',
    'May I install one package without the other?' => 'Yes. Although most of them require to have a working GnuPG installation, all projects are independent from each other. Using the GPGTools Installer just assures that all components (and their versions and configurations) are compatible to each other.',
    'Do I have to install every single package when downloading the GPGTools installer?' => 'No. You can chose which components to install.',
    'Can I uninstall GPGTools or package XYZ?' => 'Yes. We offer an uninstaller for each project.',
    'What is the relationship between GPGTools and package XYZ?' => 'All packages are independently developed. The GPGTools Project Team just provides a consistent infrastructure (one mailing list, one ticket system, one web site, ...) and releases the all-in-one installer.',
    'Is GPGTools the same as Gpg Tools?' => 'No - sorry for the confusion. The according author\'s web site no longer exists. It seems that for all useful purposes, Gpg Tools does not exist any longer.',
    'What are the MacGPG Tools?' => 'There is no such thing. As far as we know.',
    'Why is there an "XXX" installer and a "GPGTools" installer? Do I need both? Which one should I install first? If I install one do I need the other?' => 'Because the different packages have different maintainers and some "power users" only want to download the components they need. The safest way is just to use the GPGTools installer and select the components you want to use. As inherent to the functional principle, every package expects to have a working GnuPG installation (e.g. MacGPG2 that is included in the installer) on your system.',
);

$faq['MacGPG2'] = array(
    'What if I have my own self-compiled version of GnuPG V1 or V2?' => 'No problem. MacGPG will be installed at /usr/lib/MacGPG1 and /usr/lib/MacGPG2 - this way it is very easy to uninstall. Although, you might want to check the symlinks /usr/local/bin/gpg and /usr/local/bin/gpg2. Furthermore, MacGPG2 package installations older than 2.0.17 will be removed.',
    'Why is there a "MacGPG1" and "MacGPG2"?' => 'GnuPG comes in two flavours: version 1 is the well known and portable standalone version, whereas version 2 is the enhanced variant. If you are uncertain install MacGPG2.',
);

$faq['GPG Keychain Access'] = array(
    'Why does the message "This key may be unsafe" appear?' => 'This happens when you are using a key or configuration that might not conform to <a href="http://www.keylength.com/en/compare/">todays security standards</a>. Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/GPGTools/GPGKeychainAccess/wiki/FAQ">GPG Keychain Access Wiki</a> for further details.',
);

$faq['GPGMail'] = array(
    'Why can\'t I see my secret key in Mail.app?' => 'Try to run the <a href="installer/index.php">GPGTools</a> or <a href="macgpg2/index.php">MacGPG2</a> installer. This issue can occur when the file ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf is broken. You can test it by running \'if ( gpg2 --gpgconf-test ) ; then echo "fine"; else echo "broken"; fi\'.',
    'What if I update Mac OS X? Will this break GPGMail?' => 'It can happen that the bundle/plugin gets disabled after some OS X updates. Try to run the <a href="installer/index.php">GPGTools</a> or <a href="gpgmail/index.php">GPGMail</a> installer. They will update the bundle automatically. You can also use the <a href="gpgpreferences/index.php">GPG Preferences Pane</a> to fix the current version or wait with the update till we publish an updated version via Sparkle (the internal update mechanism). If you are interested in the details have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/GPGTools/GPGMail/wiki/Not-working-anymore-after-an-OS-update">according wiki page</a>.',
    'I\'ve an other issue with GPGMail. What now?' => 'Sorry for any inconvenience. First, try to run our <a href="installer/index.php">GPGTools installer</a>. Please also have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/gpgtools/GPGMail/wiki/FAQ">GPGMail FAQ</a>.',
    'Will GPGMail run under OS X Lion 10.7?' => 'Not yet, but <a href="http://gpgtools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/65764/tickets/135">we are working on it</a>.',
    'Why can\'t I see the content of my e-mails anymore after installing GPGMail?' => 'Unfortunately this is a <a href="http://gpgtools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/65764/tickets/94">known issue</a> mentioned on the <a href="gpgmail/index.php">GPGMail page</a>.',
);


$faq['Any Other Business'] = array(
    'I have a question / an issue not listed here.

You can also <a href="about.php">contact us</a> via mail or twitter. Additionally, most projects have a wiki linked on their page that might contain more information.',
    'I don\'t like what you\'re doing and I\'ll give your project very bad ratings!' => 'Don\'t do that.  Instead, <a href="about.php">contact us</a> and help us to improve the project. We are working hard to bring GnuPG on the Mac in a user friendly way on the highest quality level possible.',
    'I like what you\'re doing and I would like to help' => 'Wonderful.
