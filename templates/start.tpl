                Yes, almost all components of the current GPGTools package run
                under OS X Lion. However, <a href="gpgmail/index.php">GPGMail</a>
                is not yet compatbile and will be disabled by Apple Mail on
                first startup after updating to Mac OS X Lion. This is how
                Apple deals with third-party plugins.
                Nevertheless, we're
                <a href="http://gpgtools.lighthouseapp.com/projects/65764/tickets/135">working on an update</a>
                of GPGMail that will run under Mac OS X Lion and it will be
                available soon (see our <a href="faq.php#3.4">FAQ</a>).
                You will be notified via this website and
                <a href="about.php">our other channels</a> once the update is
                available.
                In case you want to speed up the process,
                <a href="donate.php">why not support us</a>?
                In the meantime you could
                <a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html">ask Apple</a>
                to support Mail bundles officially and use
                <a href="gpgservices/index.php">GPGServices</a> to handle
                encrypted messages.
